    There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
    Goodbye I'm going home<br>
    I don't care no more so don't you worry<br>
    Goodbye I'm going home</p>
<p>
    I hate the way that even though you know you're wrong
    You say you're right<br>
    I hate the books you read and all your friends<br>
    Your music's shite it keeps me up all night<br></p>
<p>
    There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
    Goodbye I'm going home<br>
    I don't care no more so don't you worry<br>
    Goodbye I'm going home<br></p>
<p>
    I hate the way that you are so sarcastic<br>
    And you're not very bright<br>
    You think that everything you've done's fantastic<br>
    Your music's shite it keeps me up all night<br></p>
<p>
    And it will be nice to be alone<br>
    For a week or two<br>
    But I know that I will be<br>
    Right back here with you<br></p>
<p>
    There's no need for you to say you're sorry<br>
    Goodbye I'm going home<br>
    I don't care no more so don't you worry<br>
    Goodbye I'm going home<br></p></h4>
